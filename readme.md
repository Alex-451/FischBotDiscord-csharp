A Discord bot using Discord.NET.

## Getting started

Rename `sampleappsettings.config` to `appsettings.config` and add your Discord bot token to it before running. If you are running from the source code, this should be all you need to do besides running the solution in your IDE of choice.

If you are using the a release package, do the following:

1. Unzip `linux-x64.zip`
1. Run `chmod +x ./FischBot` in the `linux-x64` directory
2. Run `./FischBot` to start the bot
